## Goals
The goal of this project is not to invent a new algorithm/model to detect chess pieces and board positions But rather to leverage,combine and improve on the existing algorithms and APIs to create
an end-user application
## How it works
User logs in to their account and select game mode like they would on Lichess. <br/>
Put your phone at a steady angle to the board where it can see the whole board clearly <br/>
If its your turn, play the move on the board, otherwise, wait for opponent's move, this will be announced via a text-to-speech subsystem <br />
