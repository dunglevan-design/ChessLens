# ChessLens
Over the board chess but online with computer vision
## Goals
The goal of this project is not to invent a new algorithm/model to detect chess pieces and board positions But rather to leverage and combine the existing algorithms and APIs to create
an end-user application
## How it works
User logs in to their account and select game mode like they would on Lichess. 
Put your phone at a steady angle to the board where it can see the whole board clearly
start playing on your physical board.
## Stack
React Native, React Native Camera Vision ,Firebase, Django, OpenCV, Tensorflow.
